Wallis had evidently been asked to assure Bertet that he could expect 'candid and upright dealing' from Collins, no doubt in view of the quantity of books he was being asked to obtain. After Bertet had initiated the correspondence with Collins in September 1670, Collins had sent Bertet a packet of books and written to ask him 'to procure many more'.

In the meeting on 9 May it was ordered that the Society's clerk ‘write a fair copy of this discourse’ and ‘make the schemes contained in it large, against the next meeting’. This copy is clearly London Royal Society Early Letters W1, No. 18; Birch, History of the Royal Society II, 88. The hypothesis was discussed for the first time at the meeting of the Society on 16 May and objections brought forth by members were communicated by Oldenburg to Wallis on the following day. His reply, dated 19 May, was read at the meeting on 23 May where it produced further objections. These were likewise brought to Wallis's attention by Oldenburg in his letters of 29 and 31 May. Wallis in turn replied to these in his letter to Oldenburg of 2 June and was later able to participate personally in discussions, by being present at the meeting of 20 June. | Wallis sent a slightly extended Latin translation (London Royal Society MS. 368, No. 1, pp. 1-29) of this letter to Oldenburg in February 1667/8. At the same time, he also sent him translations of two others: that of  18/[28].VII.1666, which was published as an appendix to the hypothesis in the same issue of Philosophical Transactions, and that of 24.VII/[3.VIII].1666, which was likewise printed in Philosophical Transactions No. 16.

Hobbes had dedicated the second edition of his Quadratura circuli to Cosimo III de' Medici after meeting the prince a number of times at the end of May and beginning of June 1669 (see WOOD, Athenae Oxonienses III, 1208). Hobbes had also augmented his demonstrations with a critical response to Wallis's first refutation. A review of the second edition of Wallis's refutation appeared in the Philosophical Transactions No. 55 (17 January 1670), 1121-[1122].

The three highest terms of the cubic are identical (a3 - 15a2 + 54a); the variation of the constant term in both the cubic and the quadratic equation is explained by the construction of repeated differences: for the cubic, the third difference (-6) is constant, for the quadratic, the second difference (+2). The date and circumstances emerge from Wallis's remarks on the draft (OXFORD Bodleian Library MS Don. d. 45, f. 149r-149v). The form of the paper sent (CAMBRIDGE University Library MS Add. 9597/13/6, f.252r-252v) and the wording on the cover suggests that it was conveyed as an enclosure to a letter to Oldenburg, possibly WALLIS-OLDENBURG 10/[20].III.1669/70.",,a7ba891d-e7ab-4577-8257-72863165cbdd,http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/work/a7ba891d-e7ab-4577-8257-72863165cbdd

Fermat's reaction to this work was to pose Wallis and other mathematicians two problems on number theory. A handwritten paper containing these problems and addressed first to Digby was brought to Paris by the physician Pierre Borel together with a second, essentially identical paper addressed to Claude-Martin de Laurendière, physician in Paris, intended for the mathematicians of Europe. Fermat clearly sent two papers because he suspected (correctly) that Digby might be away from Paris at the time. In fact, it was not until March 1657 that Thomas White brought Fermat's first challenge, together with a letter from Digby, to Brouncker in London. Brouncker subsequently forwarded the challenge to Wallis on 5/[15] March 1656/7. See Wallis-Digby 3/[13].IX.1657. While this paper was still awaiting Digby's return to Paris, the other addressed to Laurendière was quickly forwarded by Willem Boreel, the Ambassador of the United Provinces in Paris, to the mathematical professors Jakob Golius and Frans van Schooten in Leiden, where it arrived on 28 January 1656/7 (old style). See Schooten-Wallis [8]/18.III.1658; Fermat, Œuvres (1891-1912/22) II, 332. Frenicle saw the challenge in Paris and immediately provided solutions to both problems. See Digby-Wallis [22.VII]/1.VIII.1657.

Although there is only one insignificant difference between the two papers in the wording of problems, the first and last lines of the one intended for Wallis were omitted from that sent to the Low Countries.

Under the two problems Borel added a note to Digby: `Monsieur de Fermat a voulu écrire ces questions qu'il n'a encore proposées à personne, et vous estes par ainsi le premier qui les pourrez proposer à tous les Mathematiciens de Paris, d'Hollande, d'Angleterre, etc.' See Frenicle, Solutio duorum problematum, Paris 1657, sig. a iiir. Above the two problems White also added a note: `A challenge from M. Fermat, for D. Wallis, with the hearty commendations of the messenger, Thomas White.' See Wallis, Commercium epistolicum, 1; Opera mathematica II, 759. For the history of the contest,

The challenge was made to the English mathematicians in a paper sent to Digby, and thereafter brought by White to Brouncker in London. Brouncker sent his reply containing a solution to Digby for forwarding to Fermat almost certainly in March. Shortly afterwards, Wallis, who had probably been attending the funeral of Richard Bate in Kent, met with Brouncker in London on his way back to Oxford and was informed of the new developments: Wallis-Digby 3/[13].IX.1657 and Wallis-Digby 26.XII.1657/[5.I.1658]. Wallis did not see the complete paper and only received the challenge in its original wording when Brouncker forwarded it to him in September. See Brouncker-Wallis 11/[21].IX.1657. Essentially the same problem, but differently expressed and with partly different cases to be solved, was sent written in French to Frenicle. Mylon included a transcript of this in a letter to Huygens (Mylon-Huygens [20.II]/2.III.1656/7; Huygens, Œuvres complètes II, 8-11), who forwarded it to Schooten (Huygens-Schooten [27.II]/9.III.1656/7; Huygens, Œuvres complètes II, 13-14). See Huygens, Œuvres complètes II, 11; Fermat, Œuvres (1891-1912/22) II, 333-4; Wallis, Opera mathematica II, 837-8.

Martin Lister had published a paper in which he fluxed crude antimony or stibnite with cawke, resulting in antimony glass, like “polish’d steel”. He then promised “another time” to discuss the making of mirrors or speculums with his antimony glass, and apparently also promised a sample to Newton, though no correspondence has survived between them. Lister’s paper appeared in the same edition of the Philosophical Transactions as Franciscus Linus’s refutation of Newton’s theory of color, and it is thus more than likely that Newton saw it, and subsequently enquired for samples via an intermediary at Cambridge.

Email: jean.agnew@virgin.net
Message follows:
This letter isn't by Robert Paston, 1st earl of Yarmouth, It's his grandson Charles Lord Paston (1673-1718), son of the 2nd earl of Yarmouth and also grandson of Charles II. He accompanied the earl of Portland on his mission to France in 1697, as did Lister, so the content makes sense. The stressful election referred to on 12 September was probably that of 1698 when he stood for Norfolk and came bottom of the poll on 3 August. I could probably read the letter from Robert Paston to Sir William D'Oyley the elder  (MS Tanner 53 fol. 228) as I have been reading his handwriting for years and I don't suppose it was worse in his youth than it became in old age. If you've got a scan of this letter I'll be happy to have a crack at it.",b8c1ce07-aa7b-4386-97f8-f6ca219cf575,http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/work/b8c1ce07-aa7b-4386-97f8-f6ca219cf575

Like Gregory, with whom he shared episcopalian principles, Moray had studied at St. Andrews and it was probably through his favour that the young mathematician was appointed to the newly-created professorship there in 1668. Evidence suggests that they had been in contact during Gregory's stay in Italy and possibly also beforehand. See Collins-Gregory ?.II.1667/8 (Rigaud, Correspondence of Scientific Men II, 174-9) and Collins-Gregory 30.XII.1668/[10.I.1669] (Turnbull, James Gregory, 54-8). | Since Moray had for a long time been a friend of Huygens, and was also acquainted with Wallis, it is conceivable that he suggested to Gregory that he submit copies of his work on the quadrature of the circle and the hyperbola to these two mathematicians for their opinion. It appears that Gregory sent two copies of the book to England and that these arrived in early February 1668. Probably they were addressed to Moray, although Collins suggests that they were sent to Gregory's friend, the bookseller Samuel Thompson. See Collins-Gregory ?.II.1667/8; Rigaud, Correspondence of Scientific Men II, 174-9, 174. One of these, intended as a copy for reprinting, was given to Thompson, who lent it to Collins. Collins in turn showed it to Brouncker, who then gave a short account of the work at the meeting of the Royal Society on 27 February 1668. See Birch, History of the Royal Society II, 253. | The other copy would clearly have been sent to Wallis at the same time. Assuming Moray was the sender, he would as patron understandably have asked the Savilian professor to give his opinion privately, thus explaining the reference to a `familiar letter' in Wallis-Brouncker 4/[14].XI.1668. Wallis also gave a short account to Collins at the same time. See Wallis-Collins 27.II/[8.III].1668. Huygens published his opinion under the title `Examen de Vera Circuli & Hyperboles Quadratura' in the Journal des Sςavans of 2 July 1668 (new style), 52-6.

He also suggested that the amended version of the letter be communicated to  the Society and registered. Oldenburg duly carried out the instructions and the paper was read at the meeting of the Society on 16/[26] July and entered in the Register Book. See Birch, History of the Royal Society II, 306. | Wallis later sent a copy of the letter, incorporating alterations and additions, to Brouncker (Wallis-Brouncker VII/VIII.1668). He reports on this in Wallis-Oldenburg 3/[13].VIII.1668, and therefore it is probable that the letter was sent shortly before this time. There, Wallis indicates to Oldenburg that he would like this amended version to be published in the Philosophical Transactions.

On recognizing that London Royal Society Early Letters W1, No. 55, pp. 1-4 of 8 pp. was too long, Wallis produced a shorter version London Royal Society Early Letters W1, No. 56, 4 pp. and No. 55, pp. 5-8 of 8 pp. and then inadvertently sent both versions to Oldenburg as enclosures to Wallis-Oldenburg 20/[30].VII.1668. Wallis did not become aware of the mistake until Oldenburg returned the sheets concerned in Oldenburg-Wallis early XI.1668. In that letter, Oldenburg asked how to proceed with the publication of Wallis's paper, the first part of which had in the meantime been printed in Philosophical Transactions No. 39 (21 September 1668), based on the incomplete draft London Royal Society Early Letters W1, No. 55, pp. 1-4 of 8 pp. Wallis sent both versions back to Oldenburg on 10/[20] November 1668 (see Wallis-Oldenburg 7/[17].XI.1668) with the instruction to `omitt what is in the first leaf of the two sheets [i.e. of London Royal Society Early Letters W1, No. 56, 4 pp. and No. 55, pp. 5-8 of 8 pp.], till you come to Porro (ut minutiora quaedam praeteream) &c.

A corresponding introductory comment (London Royal Society Early Letters W1, No. 57, upper fragment) was inserted by Oldenburg before the continuation of Wallis's letter, now based on London Royal Society Early Letters W1, No. 56, 4 pp. and No. 55, pp. 5-8 of 8 pp., in Philosophical Transactions No. 41 (16 November 1668), 825-6.",,c5960a50-58ec-4fe8-93f6-c99af258349b,http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/work/c5960a50-58ec-4fe8-93f6-c99af258349b

In this letter Wallis informs Sluse that he had discovered the fundamental principle employed by Wren. To this end he gives an ac¬count of a conversation which he had had with Wren on the topic. The present letter was sent by Oldenburg as an enclosure to his own letter to Sluse of 14/[24] September 1669 (OLDENBURG, Correspondence VI, 232-5). Since neither letter arrived, Sluse asked Oldenburg to send him the most substantial parts again. Oldenburg duly complied and sent a copy of Wallis's letter as an enclosure to OLDENBURG-SLUSE 26.I/[5.II].1669/70 (OLDENBURG, Correspondence VI, 447-8). From the absence of lines proposed for cor¬rection in WALLIS-OLDENBURG 17/[27].X.1669, it is apparent that this copy is not identical with the original letter sent.

It would appear that the present letter was the first occasion on which he presented the results of his investigations. Of this he writes in a letter quoted by Collins (Wallis-Collins (?) ?.1673; Leibniz, Sämtliche Schriften und Briefe III, 1, 400): `I had not then seen Deschartes Geometry nor had read any other Algebra but Mr Oughtreds Clavis, nor knew anything of the Contents of it, but on this occasion found out the Booke in a freinds hands in London, from whom I procured the use of it for a weeke or two, I found there my two first Rules for Cubick aequations to be cited by him as Cardans rules without any Demonstration or Reason of them given.' In his letter to Collins of 8/[18] April 1673, he writes of the method of depressing biquadratic equations to quadratic by the help of a cubic as being `the sum of what I wrote to Mr. Smith, then mathematick professor in Cambridge, Nov. 28. 1648'. Here and in two further letters to Collins written at the same time (Wallis-Collins 29.III/[8.IV].1673 and Wallis-Collins 12/[22].IV.1673) is also to be found the probable mathematical content of the present letter to Smith. | Although Wallis gives the date of this letter as being 28 November 1648, this is possibly the result of a confusion with a letter written by Smith of that date, which appears to have been the reply to it.",,190050e0-3a31-4cc7-968a-e98d574a7d87,http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/work/190050e0-3a31-4cc7-968a-e98d574a7d87

Neile was requested to complete the theory and 'to consider how to verify his principles by experiments, and to accommodate them to the rules of Dr. Wren and Monsr. Huygens'. At the meeting the following week, Neile was reminded of this and in reply indicated that the work had already been started; see BIRCH, History of the Royal Society II, 361, 362. The next day, Neile wrote to Oldenburg that he would revise and stylistically polish the theory sometime in the future (see NEILE-OLDENBURG 7/[17].V. 1669; OLDENBURG, Correspondence V, 517-18). This evidently prompted Oldenburg to send Wallis a copy of the theory he already had at his disposal rather than waiting for the promised revised version. The content of the original paper cannot be ascertained with certainty. After the sentence ending 'relinquenda censeo' in the middle of f. 5r the ink is visibly different and corresponds to that used for making stylistic improvements to earlier parts of the text. This suggests that these passages and corrections were added sometime afterward and were not included in the copy which Oldenburg sent to Wallis on 8 May. The Register Book copy incorporates Neile's corrections, but leaves out all of the text in the revised paper from the beginning of f. 6r to the end of f. 7r. The final passages contained on f. 8r (with the exception of 'debet ergo S. reverti velocitate SE + 2AE') is designated in the Register Book as an 'Appendix', no doubt reflecting their being a later addition.",,8778af2e-5906-4997-8807-e60050ba8171,http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/work/8778af2e-5906-4997-8807-e60050ba8171

Both Hyrne's letter and Wallis's reply were produced at the meeting of the Royal Society on 14 April 1670, whereupon it was ordered that they should be read at the following meeting. Hyrne's 'Scheme' or diagram was evidently considered to be too small, for it was also ordered that it should be redrawn in larger scale by an amanuensis. The diagrams contained in the Letter Book are presumably the result of this re-drawing. Hyrne's hypothesis of the tides was duly read by Oldenburg at the meeting of the Royal Society on 21 April 1670.

He claimed that it was printed in Paris, although Wallis describes this as pretence (Hobbius Heauton-timorumenos, 127-8). It was reprinted with replies to objections by Wallis and Rooke as an appendix to Dialogus physicus (1661). Amended versions appeared in an appendix to Problemata physica, London 1662 (Opera philosophica IV, 378-82), and in Seven  Philosophical Problems, printed in London 1682 (English Works VII, 59-62). | The acronym is solved by Hobbes in the Dialogus physicus, London 1661, as ‘Un Autre Que Roberval’ (Opera philosophica IV, 295). As he explains in Seven Philosophical Problems, he had the paper printed in Paris ‘on purpose to see what objections would be made to it by our professors of algebra here’ (English Works VII, 59). | As confirmed in Wallis-Brouncker? 23.VI/[3.VII].1661, the printed paper contained a diagram, supplemented here from the English translation in Wallis's Hobbius Heauton-timorumenos. The handwritten corrections to the present exemplar probably originate from Hobbes himself, who is known to have subjected the demonstration to numerous revisions. At the foot of the reverse is a refutation (in Hobbes's hand) entitled ‘La Refufation monstrante que la droit Y Z produite ne tombe sur P : c'est a dire que en la Triangle DY P la costé P D n'est pas egale a DC, mais plus court.’ This is possibly the refutation referred to by Hobbes in Seven Philosophical Problems (English Works VII, 59).",,43f1edd6-cc64-4c72-9820-a0e89afd56a1,http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/profile/work/43f1edd6-cc64-4c72-9820-a0e89afd56a1
